HATE IT WITH A FIREY PASSION >:<>. Okay after more time it's growing on me but I really wish this class gave us more of an on ramp. I had to read the textbook to be able to do anything. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Not really?

Start early. Just write something down. Once you have one thing it's easy to go from there, the blank template is the intimidating part. Also if you randly start getting error in a part of the code you didn't touch, look for stray {}s they will wreak every thing after them.
